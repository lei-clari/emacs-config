# Personal Configurations

## emacs
My emacs configuration dervied from several online resources

* https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs

## zsh
I found zsh to be much more convenient:

Hence include a .zshrc for the plugins and theme I used.

## Productivity Tricks
### Google Calendar
* In Calendar -> Settings -> General -> Event Settings -> Default
  Duration to 27 mins.  Actually, 27 mins are enough for most
  meetings, and leave 3 mins to run to the next
  meeting. Unfortunatelly, there is no reminder to end a meeting. 
  
* Click corresponding calendar and event notifications, set a
  notification of 3 minutes.  The default 10 mins is useless. I seldom
  take an action if the next meeting is still 10 mins away. 3 mins
  push you to wrap up what you are doing and get ready for the next
  meeting.
